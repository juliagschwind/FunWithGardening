Fun with Gardening intends to teach children about plants and how to grow them. The player is in charge of a garden and can buy different seeds which can be planted. Every plant has certain characteristics, some of which can be viewed in its profile from the start (for example the radish likes cool areas), others have to be unlocked. The challenge is to make the plant as happy as possible based on its profile. If a plant is very happy over its lifespan, this will be reflected in a large harvest which can be sold at the store for a high price but if the plant is very unhappy, it can only be sold at a low price or it might even die before the harvest. The game is partitioned into levels, each with a different learning objective (for example “Watering” or “Friends”) and challenges which need to be overcome to level up. Every level starts with a short introduction to the topic and unlocks new plants and actions which fit the current learning objective. The overall aim is to build a garden with a large harvest potential while learning about different species of plants.
